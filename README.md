# Rate My Professor UC Berkeley
Rate My Professor Chrome Extension for UC Berkeley Course Catalog

## How to Load
This Chrome extension can be loaded as unpacked extension under the "More tools" -> "Extensions" menu on Chrome (just load the chrome_extension folder). You may have to switch your extensions to "developer mode" (at the top).

## More Details
Unforunately, I do not believe I will release it publicly on the Chrome extension "store" because RMP has a history of taking such extensions down. So feel free to share this link, but it would be aweseome if it did not get published. Unless someone knows they will not take it down. Also, refresh the page if nothing shows up! There might be small bugs, but I would love to iron them out.

## Technical Info
So this extension actually utilizes web scraping to find the professor ratings. If you would like to see the back-end code, please get in contact with me!
